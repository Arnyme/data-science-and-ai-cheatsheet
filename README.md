# Comprehensive Data Science and AI Summary with Python

## Introduction

This summary covers essential concepts and techniques in data science and artificial intelligence using Python. It's designed to serve both newcomers to the field and experienced professionals looking to refresh their knowledge. Each section provides an overview of the topic, practical examples, and tips for effective implementation.

## 1. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the crucial first step in any data science project. It involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for analysis and modeling.

### 1.1 Handling Missing Data

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'B': [5, np.nan, np.nan, 8]})

# Drop rows with missing values
df_dropped = df.dropna()

# Fill missing values with the mean of the column
df_filled = df.fillna(df.mean())

print("Original DataFrame:\n", df)
print("\nDataFrame after dropping NA:\n", df_dropped)
print("\nDataFrame after filling NA with mean:\n", df_filled)
```

Tips:
- Consider the nature of your data and the reason for missing values before choosing a method.
- For time series data, consider forward-fill or backward-fill methods.

Advanced:
- Use multiple imputation techniques for more robust handling of missing data.
- Implement custom imputation logic based on domain knowledge.

### 1.2 Encoding Categorical Variables

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'blue']})

# Label Encoding
le = LabelEncoder()
df['color_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(df['color'])

# One-Hot Encoding
ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded = ohe.fit_transform(df[['color']])
df_onehot = pd.DataFrame(encoded, columns=ohe.get_feature_names(['color']))

print("Original DataFrame:\n", df)
print("\nDataFrame after Label Encoding:\n", df)
print("\nDataFrame after One-Hot Encoding:\n", df_onehot)
```

Tips:
- Use label encoding for ordinal categories and one-hot encoding for nominal categories.
- Be cautious of high cardinality features when using one-hot encoding.

Advanced:
- Explore target encoding for high cardinality features in supervised learning tasks.
- Consider feature hashing as an alternative to one-hot encoding for large datasets.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is the process of analyzing and visualizing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load sample data
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Correlation heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap")
plt.show()

# Distribution plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['sepal_length'], kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Sepal Length")
plt.show()

# Box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='species', y='petal_length', data=df)
plt.title("Petal Length by Species")
plt.show()
```

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import pandas as pd

# Load sample data
df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
X = df.drop('species', axis=1)
y = df['species']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

### 3.2 Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# Perform K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], marker='x', color='red', s=200)
plt.title("K-Means Clustering")
plt.show()
```

Tips:

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Prepare your data (example)
texts = ["I love this movie!", "This film was terrible."]
labels = [1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize and encode the texts
encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True, return_tensors='pt')
labels = torch.tensor(labels)

# Train the model (simplified example)
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

for epoch in range(3):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(**encodings, labels=labels)
    loss = outputs.loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Make predictions
input_text = "I enjoyed watching this movie."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model(**inputs)
prediction = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
print(f"Sentiment: {'Positive' if prediction == 1 else 'Negative'}")
```

dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31', freq='D')
ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(len(dates)).cumsum(), index=dates)

# Plot the time series
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(ts)
plt.title('Sample Time Series Data')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.show()

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(ts, order=(1, 1, 1))
results = model.fit()

# Make predictions
forecast = results.forecast(steps=30)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(ts, label='Observed')
plt.plot(forecast, label='Forecast')
plt.title('Time Series Forecast')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("LinearRegressionExample").getOrCreate()

# Create a sample dataset
data = [(1, 2.0), (2, 4.0), (3, 6.0), (4, 8.0), (5, 10.0)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["x", "y"])

# Prepare the data for ML
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["x"], outputCol="features")
df = assembler.transform(df)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data = df.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3], seed=42)

# Create and train the model
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="y")
model = lr.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(test_data)
predictions.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

import pickle
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the pre-trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
